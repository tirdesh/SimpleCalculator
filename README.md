## **Simple Calculator**
Build an expression calculator using HTML Canvas following the mock image provided.

### **User Requirements:**
1. As a user, I should be able to evaluate an expression using the calculator when the "=" button is clicked.
2. As a user, I should be able to delete a character on the expression using "Back".

4. As a user, I should be able to use "+ (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), / (divide), % (modulus)" arithmetic operators to construct the expression.

### **Technical Requirements:**
1. The goal of this assignment is to learn about JavaScript Canvas API.
2. No JavaScript frameworks should be used.
3. No CSS frameworks should be used.
4. UI should look exactly as the mock.
5. Should document your code extensively.
6. Should have .gitignore, and ReadMe.md files.
7. The readMe.md file should have a markdown with the project description and instructions to run the project.

# Work Done
1. Created a basic html page that renders a simple calculator using javascript canvas api.
2. Expression evaluation is handled.
3. Documented comments in html/js files.

# To run the code
1. Clone the repository to your local setup.
2. Use vscode with live server to open index.html or open directly via browser.
3. As this assignment is made mostly by using html and js no additional packages are required.
